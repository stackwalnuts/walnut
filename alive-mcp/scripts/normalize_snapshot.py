"""Normalize a raw MCP Inspector CLI response for golden-fixture use.

Reads the Inspector's JSON stdout on stdin, sorts top-level list
elements by a stable identity key (``name`` for tools and prompts,
``uri`` for resources), sorts every dict key recursively, pretty-prints
with two-space indent, and writes to stdout with a trailing newline.

Usage
-----
    python3 normalize_snapshot.py <method>

    where <method> is one of:
        tools/list      — sorts tools[] by .name
        resources/list  — sorts resources[] by .uri
        prompts/list    — sorts prompts[] by .name

Exit codes
----------
    0  success
    1  missing/invalid method argument
    2  stdin was empty or not valid JSON

This helper is the single source of truth for snapshot normalization.
``scripts/run-inspector-snapshot.sh`` invokes it after running the
Inspector; ``tests/test_contracts.py`` invokes it when regenerating an
in-memory snapshot to diff against the committed golden. Keeping
normalization in one place eliminates drift between "how the golden was
built" and "how the test compares".
