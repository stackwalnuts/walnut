"""Structured response envelope for alive-mcp tools.

Every tool in the v0.1 roster (list_walnuts, get_walnut_state,
read_walnut_kernel, list_bundles, get_bundle, read_bundle_manifest,
search_world, search_walnut, read_log, list_tasks) returns the envelope
produced by :func:`ok` on success or :func:`error` on failure. The
envelope is hand-assembled to match MCP's ``CallToolResult`` schema
without importing any pydantic model — keeping ``envelope.py`` import-
cost zero and stdlib-pure is the point. FastMCP happily accepts
plain-dict returns that match the schema.

MCP ``CallToolResult`` schema (2025-06-18)
------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    {
      "content": [TextContent | ImageContent | ...],   # required
      "structuredContent": dict | None,                # optional
      "isError": bool,                                 # default False
    }

``content`` is what clients display to humans (text blocks). New clients
read ``structuredContent`` for machine-parseable data. Clients that
still predate the structured-content field fall back to parsing
``content[0].text`` as JSON; we render that way so both paths work.

Error envelope shape
--------------------

The success envelope's ``structuredContent`` carries the tool's return
payload. Dict payloads flow through unchanged (merged with any
``**meta``); non-dict payloads (lists, scalars) are wrapped under a
``data`` key so ``structuredContent`` is always a JSON object, as MCP
requires. The error envelope's ``structuredContent`` is a fixed
record::

    {
      "error": "<code-without-ERR_-prefix>",     # e.g. "WALNUT_NOT_FOUND"
      "message": "<formatted template>",          # from errors.ERRORS
      "suggestions": ["...", "..."]               # from errors.ERRORS
    }

The ``error`` field drops the ``ERR_`` prefix to follow the
Merge/Workato convention cited in the spec — shorter identifiers, same
information content. The full :class:`ErrorCode` enum value (with
prefix) still drives everything internally.

Why hand-build instead of importing ``mcp.types.CallToolResult``
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Import cost.** ``envelope`` is hot — every tool call assembles
   one. Importing pydantic types pulls in validation machinery we don't
   need on the return path (FastMCP validates on the way out).
2. **Error isolation.** If the mcp SDK churns its model shape between
   1.27 and 2.0 (it is still pre-2.0), our envelope tests catch the
   drift at build time, not at runtime.
3. **Testability.** Pure-dict assembly means tests can assert
   ``response["structuredContent"]["error"] == "WALNUT_NOT_FOUND"``
   without instantiating a validator.

mask-error-details invariant
----------------------------

:func:`error` never emits an absolute filesystem path in ``message``.
Message templates in :mod:`alive_mcp.errors` are pre-audited for that
property (tested by the no-absolute-path tests in test_errors.py), and
the kwargs this module accepts are formatted into those templates
verbatim — so if a caller passes ``walnut="/Users/me/..."`` the leak
is at the call site, not here. Guidance: callers always pass caller-
facing identifiers (walnut names, bundle names, kernel file stems,
query strings). The T12 audit writer captures internal paths for
debugging; the envelope never does.

:func:`error_from_exception` takes the stricter stance: it NEVER
surfaces ``str(exc)`` to the client. Unknown codes degrade to "An
unknown error occurred." rather than echoing the exception message.
The tool layer's contract is that it only raises codes in
:data:`errors.ERROR_CODES`; this branch is the safety net if that
contract is ever violated, and preserving the mask-error-details
promise matters more than losing debug detail (which the audit log
captures anyway).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data:

        of the tool's own contract. Dict payloads flow through

        are wrapped under a ``data`` key so ``structuredContent`` is
        always a JSON object (MCP requires object for this field).
    **meta:
        Optional metadata merged into ``structuredContent`` alongside
        the payload. Typical keys are pagination signals
        (``next_cursor``, ``total``). When a meta key collides with a
        payload key, the meta dict is nested under a reserved

    -----
    ``content[0].text`` is a JSON serialization of the structured
    payload, so legacy clients that only read text content still get
    usable data. ``separators=(",", ":")`` keeps the text tight; LLMs
    read JSON fine either way but smaller payloads cost fewer tokens.

    ----------
    code:
        An :class:`errors.ErrorCode` member or the equivalent ``ERR_*``

        envelope (the tool layer should not be emitting unknown codes,

    suggestions:
        Keyword-only override for the ``structuredContent.suggestions``
        list. When ``None`` (the default), the static codebook list for
        ``code`` is used. When supplied, the provided list REPLACES the
        static list — callers that want both should concatenate
        explicitly. Every string is run through :func:`_redact_paths`
        so dynamic suggestions (e.g. fuzzy-matched walnut paths) cannot
        leak absolute filesystem paths if a caller passes them
        accidentally. ``None`` and ``[]`` are treated distinctly: the
        first falls back to the codebook, the second emits an empty

    **template_kwargs:
        Values substituted into the message template. Keys that the
        template does not reference are ignored — this is intentional,
        so callers can pass a consistent set of context kwargs
        (``walnut=..., bundle=...``) across calls without keeping per-

        **Never pass absolute filesystem paths.** The envelope redacts
        them (defense-in-depth: any string kwarg containing an
        absolute-path indicator is replaced with ``"<path>"`` before
        templating, and the final formatted message gets a second
        redaction pass), but the caller is still the right place to
        pass caller-facing identifiers — walnut names, bundle names,
        kernel file stems, query strings — not server-internal paths.
