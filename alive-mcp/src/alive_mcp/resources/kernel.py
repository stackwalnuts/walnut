"""Kernel-file MCP resources (fn-10-60k.10 / T10).

Exposes the four kernel files -- ``key``, ``log``, ``insights``, ``now``
-- per walnut as MCP resources via the ``alive://`` URI scheme. Clients
that prefer resources over tools (Claude Desktop "attach as context",
Cursor resource picker) list and read these; the tool-layer equivalents
in :mod:`alive_mcp.tools.walnut` remain the imperative retrieval path
for model-driven workflows.

Why these are resources AND tools (design rationale)
----------------------------------------------------
Tools and resources both serve walnut kernel data. The duplication is
INTENTIONAL:

* Resources are HOST-controlled -- the client UI enumerates them, the
  human picks, the client attaches or subscribes. ``resources/updated``
  notifications drive reactive UIs.
* Tools are MODEL-controlled -- the model issues an imperative call
  with parameters, typically mid-task.

Same bytes on disk, two doors. Picking only one would forfeit one
workflow. See the epic spec (fn-10-60k) "Tools vs resources" section.

Implementation strategy
-----------------------
FastMCP's template matcher (``ResourceTemplate.matches``) compiles
``{walnut_path}`` into ``(?P<walnut_path>[^/]+)`` -- the ``[^/]+``
excludes forward slashes, so a walnut path like
``02_Life/people/ben-flint`` does NOT match the template. Two workable
responses to that, and this module takes the second:

1. Pre-enumerate every walnut at server startup and register ONE
   concrete :class:`FunctionResource` per walnut-file pair. Fails when
   the walnut inventory changes at runtime (T11 advertises
   ``listChanged: true`` and needs fresh data on each ``list_resources``
   call). Also rejected because large worlds would register hundreds
   of handlers eagerly -- listing is fast, reading is per-URI.
2. Install LOW-LEVEL ``list_resources`` and ``read_resource`` handlers
   on ``server._mcp_server`` that:

   * List: walk the World at call-time; emit one ``types.Resource``
     per walnut x kernel file.
   * Read: parse the URI with :func:`alive_mcp.uri.decode_kernel_uri`,
     resolve through the same path-safety helpers the tool layer uses,
     read the file, return the contents.

   The low-level handlers REPLACE the FastMCP-installed ones (same
   ``request_handlers`` dict key); later registration wins.

Strategy 2 keeps the path-safety surface tight (one resolver, no
per-handler drift), keeps the list fresh (no stale cache to invalidate),
and lets T11 attach watchdog-driven ``notifications/resources/updated``
emission without shuffling registrations.

List-resources semantics
------------------------
Each ``types.Resource`` carries:

* ``uri`` -- the ``alive://`` URI from :func:`encode_kernel_uri`.
* ``name`` -- ``"<walnut-name> <file>"``, human-readable (e.g.
  ``"ben-flint log"``). Clients show this in pickers.
* ``description`` -- one-line describing the file's role in ALIVE.
* ``mimeType`` -- ``text/markdown`` for ``key|log|insights``,
  ``application/json`` for ``now``.

The listing ALWAYS enumerates all four file stems for every walnut the
``list_walnuts`` tool would find, even if the file does not yet exist
on disk. Rationale: a fresh walnut legitimately has no ``log.md``; the
client should still be able to "attach log when it appears" rather
than see the resource vanish and reappear. A ``resources/read`` on a
missing file returns an error via the envelope path, which is already
how T6 behaves. This keeps resource-list shape stable as walnuts are
populated.

Read-resource semantics
-----------------------
Returns an iterable of one :class:`ReadResourceContents`:

* ``content`` -- the file contents (str).
* ``mime_type`` -- same mapping as list.

Errors are surfaced as MCP JSON-RPC errors via ``raise McpError(...)``
with ``INVALID_PARAMS`` (-32602) for malformed URIs / missing walnuts /
missing files, and ``INTERNAL_ERROR`` (-32603) for read failures. The
protocol layer wraps the raise into a well-formed error response -- we
do NOT return an envelope dict here because resources use a different
response shape than tools (``TextResourceContents`` vs
``CallToolResult``).

``now`` file resolution
-----------------------
Tries v3 (``<walnut>/_kernel/now.json``) first, falls back to v2
(``<walnut>/_kernel/_generated/now.json``). Matches
:func:`alive_mcp.tools.walnut.read_walnut_kernel` exactly -- sharing
the resolver (``_resolve_now_path``) via a helper import keeps the
two layers from diverging.

Path safety
-----------
Every decoded URI goes through :func:`alive_mcp.paths.safe_join`
before the file is read. An escape attempt (symlink to outside the
World, ``%2E%2E`` that survived decoding somehow) produces
``INVALID_PARAMS`` rather than silently serving escape-file contents.
The walnut predicate (``_kernel/key.md`` exists and resolves inside
the World) is also enforced on every read so a URI for a
disappeared walnut is rejected.
