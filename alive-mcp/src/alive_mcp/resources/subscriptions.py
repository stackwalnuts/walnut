"""Watchdog observer -> MCP resource notifications (fn-10-60k.11 / T11).

This module connects the two halves of the resource subscription story:

* **The filesystem side** -- a :class:`watchdog.observers.Observer` running
  a single recursive watch over the resolved World root. Watchdog uses
  thread-based emitters on every supported platform (FSEvents on macOS,
  inotify on Linux, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows); the handler below
  therefore runs OFF the asyncio event loop and must marshal work back
  via :func:`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`.
* **The protocol side** -- a :class:`SubscriptionRegistry` tracking which
  resource URIs have at least one active subscriber, plus the async
  emission routine that fires ``notifications/resources/updated`` and
  ``notifications/resources/list_changed`` through the active
  :class:`mcp.server.session.ServerSession`.

The two halves talk through :class:`KernelEventHandler`, which filters
raw filesystem events down to the five URI-bearing kernel files
(``key.md``, ``log.md``, ``insights.md``, ``now.json``, and the v2
fallback ``_generated/now.json``), debounces per ``(walnut, file)`` key
for 500ms, and only emits notifications for URIs that a client is
actually subscribed to.

Design choices
--------------
**Single observer for server lifetime.** FastMCP v1.27 does not expose
reliable per-subscriber lifecycle hooks -- disconnect detection may not
emit ``unsubscribe``. Running one recursive Observer for the process
lifetime sidesteps leak-prone lazy-start/stop logic. The memory cost is
a single FSEvents subscription (macOS) or inotify watch tree (Linux) --
acceptable for a server that's already long-lived.

**Exact-filename filtering, not glob.** We match on a small allowlist:

* ``<walnut>/_kernel/key.md``
* ``<walnut>/_kernel/log.md``
* ``<walnut>/_kernel/insights.md``
* ``<walnut>/_kernel/now.json`` (v3)
* ``<walnut>/_kernel/_generated/now.json`` (v2 fallback, routes to
  the same ``now`` URI as v3)

Everything else is dropped at the filter: ``tasks.json`` /
``completed.json`` are not resources in v0.1, ``history/chapter-*.md``
are synthesized log chapters and not resources, ``links.yaml`` /
``people.yaml`` are v0.2 overflow, and ``.alive/_mcp/**`` is the
audit-log tree (filtering it here is belt-and-braces -- T12 writes
there and would otherwise trigger resource-update storms as the log
rotates).

**500ms debounce per ``(walnut, file)`` key.** The ALIVE save protocol
rewrites ``now.json`` fully each save, and ``log.md`` gets a prepend on
nearly every save. Each such write typically emits a burst of raw
events (open, multiple modified, close, sometimes a rename dance for
atomic-write tools). The debounce coalesces that burst into a single
notification per URI per 500ms window.

Debouncing is implemented with a cancellable
:func:`asyncio.call_later` per URI -- when a new event arrives on the
same URI, the existing scheduled emission is cancelled and a fresh
500ms timer starts. The emission fires after 500ms of quiet, NOT on
the leading edge. Rationale: the leading-edge notification would fire
before the file is durable on disk (atomic writes are rename-in), and
the trailing edge coincides with the close-and-fsync point.

**Emission filter.** Even with the debounce, we only actually emit a
notification if at least one subscriber has registered for the URI.
That keeps the common "nobody is listening" case free of protocol
traffic. Subscriber tracking uses a dict ``{uri: set[session_id]}``
guarded by an :class:`asyncio.Lock`.

**list_changed semantics.** The walnut inventory changes when a new
``<walnut>/_kernel/key.md`` appears (walnut created) or a tracked one
disappears (walnut deleted or renamed). We watch CREATE and DELETE
events specifically on paths ending in ``/_kernel/key.md`` and emit
``notifications/resources/list_changed`` on those transitions, also
debounced per 500ms.

Threading model
---------------
Three execution contexts interact:

1. **Watchdog emitter thread** runs :meth:`KernelEventHandler.dispatch`.
   Pure Python, no asyncio primitives. Its only job is to classify the
   event and schedule async work on the event loop.
2. **Asyncio event loop thread** runs the debounce timers, the
   subscription registry lock, and the actual
   :meth:`ServerSession.send_resource_updated` coroutine.
3. **MCP request handlers** (subscribe / unsubscribe) run in the
   asyncio loop's request context; they mutate the registry under its
   lock.

The handshake: thread 1 calls :func:`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`
with the event loop captured at observer start. The loop thread picks
up the coroutine and runs the debounce + emit logic there.

Public API
----------
* :class:`SubscriptionRegistry` -- per-URI subscriber set + lock.
* :class:`KernelEventHandler` -- watchdog handler; bridges to asyncio.
* :func:`start_observer` -- factory that wires a new Observer to a
  world root with a given registry and session accessor.
* :func:`register_subscribe_handlers` -- install MCP
  ``resources/subscribe`` and ``resources/unsubscribe`` request handlers
  on the low-level server that mutate the registry.

    """Per-URI subscriber set with an async lock.

    The registry maps a resource URI (string form, exactly as a client
    sent it on ``resources/subscribe``) to the set of session identities

    v0.1 stdio transport has exactly one session per server process, so
    the tracked set is always either empty or a singleton. The shape is
    forward-compat: once the SDK exposes a real disconnect hook, the
    identity doubles as the key the hook passes for bulk removal.

    The lock is an :class:`asyncio.Lock` because every mutation happens
    on the event loop: MCP request handlers (subscribe / unsubscribe)
    run in request context, and the emission path acquires it via a
    loop-scheduled coroutine. The watchdog emitter thread NEVER touches
    the registry directly -- it schedules work onto the loop and lets
    the loop serialize.

    the set's length check is atomic in CPython (GIL-protected), and

          2. Observer starts; FSEvents eventually delivers the stale

             URI at t_event + :data:`DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`.
          4. The client subscribes to the log URI at some t_subscribe

    :meth:`KernelEventHandler.cancel_pending` can be called before the

    The watch is recursive across the entire World root. Watchdog's
    :class:`ObservedWatch` supports per-event-type filtering, but we

    :func:`classify_path` is the single source of truth for

    ``daemon=True`` on the observer thread is load-bearing: without it,
    a runtime crash or lifespan bug that skipped ``observer.stop()``
    would leave the thread alive preventing interpreter exit. With
    daemon mode, Python tears the thread down on process exit
    regardless.

    Rationale for recursive vs per-walnut: at the v0.1 scale target (
    Patrick's ~43-walnut world), a single recursive watch is cheaper
    than 43 independent watches (one FSEvents subscription vs 43, one
    inotify watch tree vs 43 -- and inotify in particular has a
    fs.inotify.max_user_watches limit on Linux that a per-walnut
    approach would eat into). The recursive watch is also cheaper to

    The handlers mutate ``registry`` under its async lock. The
    ``session_getter`` returns the active :class:`ServerSession` (or
    None if no session is bound); we use its ``id()`` as the subscriber
    token so the same session subscribing twice is idempotent, and
    different sessions are disambiguated even when the SDK shape
    changes across versions.

    The optional ``handler_getter`` returns the active
    :class:`KernelEventHandler` (or None if the observer has not
    started yet). When provided, the subscribe handler cancels any
    pending debounce timer for the URI BEFORE recording the
    subscription. That guard closes a subtle stale-event race: on
    macOS, FSEvents coalesces with ~1s latency, so a file written to
    disk BEFORE the observer started can surface as an event AFTER
    the observer starts -- and if a client subscribes between those
    two moments, the debounced emission would fire with the (now
    matching) subscriber set and deliver a notification for an event
    that semantically predates the subscription. Cancelling on
    subscribe enforces the "notify on changes AFTER I subscribed"
    semantic consistently. See
    :meth:`KernelEventHandler.cancel_pending_for_uri` for the full
    rationale.

    ``handler_getter`` is optional for backward-compat with callers
    that wire up the registry before the observer exists (tests,
    early-lifespan paths); a ``None`` handler is treated as "no
    pending timers to cancel," which is the correct fallback.

    Why install both handlers even though v0.1 drops lazy-on-subscribe:
    the registry IS the emission filter. A client that never subscribes
    gets no ``updated`` traffic; a client that subscribes gets traffic
    until it explicitly unsubscribes OR its session tears down.
    Without the subscribe handler, every update would be dropped by
    ``has_subscribers(uri) == False`` -- functionally correct but
    protocol-incorrect (the client thinks it subscribed).

    Low-level registration via ``server._mcp_server.request_handlers``
    mirrors the T10 kernel-resource handler installation. FastMCP's
    decorator (``@server._mcp_server.subscribe_resource``) would also
    work but requires a slightly different callback shape; using the
    dict directly keeps the registration style consistent across T10
    and T11.
