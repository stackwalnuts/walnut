"""FastMCP server bootstrap for alive-mcp v0.1.

This module wires a :class:`FastMCP` instance into a runnable stdio JSON-RPC
server. It is the shell that T6-T11 hang tools and resources off. As of
T10, ``build_server`` registers:

* 10 read-only tools (T6-T9) on the tool surface.
* Kernel-file resources (T10) under the ``alive://walnut/.../kernel/*``
  URI scheme, with ``resources.subscribe=True`` and
  ``resources.listChanged=True`` advertised today and delivery landing in
  T11.
* The audit queue + writer-stub machinery (T12 replaces the writer body).

The module still owns the capability-override shim, Roots handshake, and
lifespan wiring -- the pieces that have to exist at ``initialize`` time
before any tool or resource is invoked.

Contract surface
----------------
* :func:`build_server` — construct and configure the FastMCP instance. Pure
  function returning the server plus its :class:`AppContext` holder. Used by
  tests to drive the server in-process; used by :func:`main` to run stdio.
* :func:`main` — CLI entry point wired via ``[project.scripts]``. Runs the
  stdio transport, blocks until stdin EOF, returns 0.
* :data:`APP_NAME`, :data:`PROTOCOL_VERSION_PINNED` — module-level constants
  for tests to assert against without importing pydantic types.

Capability declaration
----------------------
The MCP spec requires the server to declare its capabilities during the
``initialize`` handshake. For v0.1 we advertise:

=========================== ======= =======================================
Capability                  Value   Rationale
=========================== ======= =======================================
``tools``                   object  10-tool roster lands in T6-T9.
``tools.listChanged``       ``False`` Roster is frozen for v0.1.
``resources``               object  Kernel-file resources land in T10.
``resources.subscribe``     ``True``  Advertised today; delivery arrives in T11.
``resources.listChanged``   ``True``  Advertised today; walnut-inventory watching arrives in T11.
``logging``                 object  stderr logging endpoint.
=========================== ======= =======================================

The ``mcp>=1.27,<2.0`` low-level ``Server.get_capabilities`` builder is not
flexible enough on its own: it hard-codes ``subscribe=False`` on the
``ResourcesCapability`` and tool/resource ``listChanged`` flags are driven by
:class:`~mcp.server.lowlevel.server.NotificationOptions`. We therefore wrap
``_mcp_server.get_capabilities`` so the server advertises the combination the
v0.1 spec requires without waiting on an SDK change. See the comments on
:func:`_install_capability_override` for the forward-compat escape hatch
(once the SDK exposes a ``subscribe=`` parameter, the wrapper becomes a
no-op and can be deleted).

Roots API status (``mcp>=1.27,<2.0``)
-------------------------------------
The SDK exposes BOTH halves of the Roots protocol in the version we pin,
validated empirically during T5 implementation:

* Server-initiated ``roots/list`` — :meth:`ServerSession.list_roots` exists
  at ``mcp/server/session.py:350``. Callable from any code that has access
  to the active ``ServerSession`` (tool handlers, notification handlers).
* ``notifications/roots/list_changed`` — the low-level ``Server`` exposes
  a ``notification_handlers: dict[type, Callable]`` map. Registering a
  handler against ``types.RootsListChangedNotification`` routes the
  notification to user code. The lifespan installs that handler below.

The FastMCP convenience wrapper does not currently surface either hook on
its own public API, so we reach through ``_mcp_server`` (the low-level
:class:`~mcp.server.lowlevel.server.Server` instance FastMCP owns). This is
the same technique FastMCP itself uses internally (``_setup_handlers``).

**Why world discovery has to be deferred to post-``initialized``.** The
lifespan context manager enters BEFORE the first JSON-RPC message is read,
so there is no client session to query for Roots at that moment. We do two
things in lifespan:

1. Attempt env-fallback discovery immediately so the server can serve
   ``ERR_NO_WORLD`` coherently if Roots never arrive.
2. Register a handler for :class:`types.InitializedNotification` that,
   once fired, calls ``session.list_roots()`` and re-runs discovery with
   the combined Roots + env inputs. The handler also re-runs on every
   subsequent :class:`types.RootsListChangedNotification`.

If Roots discovery fails but env discovery succeeded, we keep the env
result and log the Roots failure on stderr. If both fail, the resolved
world stays ``None`` — the tool layer (T6+) will then emit
``ERR_NO_WORLD`` per the envelope schema without crashing the server.

Stdout discipline
-----------------
The stdio transport multiplexes JSON-RPC messages on stdout. Any
``print()`` (or dependency that writes to stdout) contaminates framing
and makes the server silently unusable. This module:

* Never calls ``print()``.
* Configures ``logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr, ...)`` BEFORE
  importing any mcp modules that might log on import.
* Never writes raw bytes to ``sys.stdout`` directly.

Dependency banners (pydantic warnings, deprecation notices) are routed
through the Python warnings filter to stderr too. MemPalace's
``mcp_server.py`` uses an fd1->fd2 redirect as belt-and-suspenders; we
keep that technique documented but do not enable it until a specific
dep escalates (``warnings`` routing + ``logging.stream=stderr`` covers
the current depset — ``mcp``, ``watchdog``).

    Notifications (``initialized``, ``roots/list_changed``) fire via
    :meth:`Server._handle_notification`, which takes only the
    notification payload — the active :class:`ServerSession` is NOT
    threaded through. The low-level ``request_ctx`` contextvar is only
    bound during request handling, never during notification handling.

    To let the ``initialized`` handler call ``session.list_roots()``,
    we need a side channel from the dispatch layer (which has the
    session) to the handler (which does not). The cheapest reliable
    side channel is to wrap :meth:`Server._handle_message` — the
    dispatch method receives ``session`` as a parameter on every call.
    We stash it on :attr:`AppContext.active_session` so the
    notification handlers can pick it up.

    The wrapper is installed once per lifespan entry and removed on
    exit (best-effort — the server process typically exits right
    after lifespan teardown, so a leaked wrapper is harmless). The
    wrapper preserves the original method's signature exactly so any
    future SDK-level change to `_handle_message` is surfaced by a
    TypeError at the wrapper boundary rather than silently breaking.

    Forward-compat note: if ``mcp`` ever adds a public hook for
    "dispatch starts" (e.g. middleware), this wrapper becomes
