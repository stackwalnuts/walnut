"""Bundle-centric read tools (fn-10-60k.7 / T7).

Three tools, all read-only, all annotated
``ToolAnnotations(readOnlyHint=True, destructiveHint=False,
openWorldHint=False, idempotentHint=True)``:

* :func:`list_bundles` -- inventory a walnut's bundles as
  ``{bundles: [{path, name, goal, status, updated, due, outcome,
  phase}, ...]}``. 8-key subset of the frozen 9-key manifest set:
  drops ``context`` (too large for list view -- available via
  ``get_bundle``) and ``active_sessions`` (internal, not useful
  cross-session).
* :func:`get_bundle` -- read a single bundle's manifest plus derived
  counts. Returns ``{manifest: {...9 keys...}, derived: {task_counts,
  raw_file_count, last_updated}}``. The ``manifest`` dict carries
  every one of the 9 frozen keys the vendored parser extracts;
  missing values appear as ``None`` so the shape is stable across
  bundles.
* :func:`read_bundle_manifest` -- narrower wrapper returning only
  ``{manifest: {...9 keys...}, warnings: [...]}``. Retained as a
  distinct tool for clients that prefer the minimal interface and
  want to surface per-key parse warnings (the derived counts carry
  I/O cost that this surface avoids).

Frozen 9-key manifest contract
------------------------------
The vendored ``walnut_paths._parse_manifest_minimal`` (see
``claude-code/plugins/alive/scripts/walnut_paths.py`` L170-228) is a
regex-minimal parser that extracts exactly these 9 keys and nothing
more:

* Simple scalars (L190): ``goal, status, updated, due, name, outcome,
  phase``.
* Multi-line or single-line context block (L198-214): ``context``.
* List derived from the ``squirrels:`` YAML list (L216-226):
  ``active_sessions``.

Any other YAML content in the manifest (``sources``,
``linked_bundles``, ``sensitivity``, ``species``, ``version``,
``tags``, ``people``, ``discovered``, ``installs``, etc.) is SILENTLY
DROPPED. This is by design -- alive-mcp has no PyYAML dep and the
regex-minimal parser was purpose-built for this. Any future need for
additional keys means extending the vendored parser with explicit
tests per key; v0.1 does not do that.

Return-shape guarantees
-----------------------
* :func:`list_bundles` returns the 8-key subset (no ``context``, no
  ``active_sessions``). Missing scalars -> ``None`` so the caller can
  dispatch on presence without special-casing missing keys.
* :func:`get_bundle` returns all 9 keys. Missing values -> ``None``.
  Derived fields:
    - ``task_counts`` -- ``{urgent, active, todo, blocked, done}``
      aggregated from ``tasks.json`` files inside the bundle.
    - ``raw_file_count`` -- count of regular files under
      ``<bundle>/raw/``. Zero when the directory is absent.
    - ``last_updated`` -- the ``updated`` field if present, else an
      ISO date derived from the bundle's most-recent file mtime.
* :func:`read_bundle_manifest` returns the same 9-key manifest plus a
  ``warnings`` list. Warnings accumulate ``"could not parse '<key>'"``
  entries when a key is completely absent from the parser output
  (defense-in-depth -- the parser already drops malformed keys, so
  the warnings list is typically empty on well-formed manifests; it
  exists so clients can distinguish "not present in the manifest"
  from "parser failure" when auditing).

Bundle identifier convention
----------------------------
The ``bundle`` param is a POSIX-relative path from the walnut root,
matching what :func:`list_bundles` returns in each entry's ``path``
field. The vendored :func:`walnut_paths.find_bundles` surfaces
bundles under two layouts -- v3 flat (``<walnut>/foo``) and v2
nested (``<walnut>/bundles/foo``) -- keyed by their POSIX relpath.
v1 legacy ``_core/_capsules/`` is NOT scanned (``_core`` is in the
vendored skip set, aligning with the plugin's v3 migration
posture); callers with legacy capsules migrate them first. Callers
pass back the ``path`` field verbatim.

Error posture
-------------
* ``ERR_NO_WORLD`` when the lifespan never resolved a World.
* ``ERR_PATH_ESCAPE`` when ``walnut`` or ``bundle`` would leave the
  World root after realpath resolution.
* ``ERR_WALNUT_NOT_FOUND`` when ``walnut`` doesn't resolve to a
  walnut. Uses the same fuzzy-suggestion wiring as the walnut tools.
* ``ERR_BUNDLE_NOT_FOUND`` when the bundle lookup fails. Includes a
  "Did you mean" suggestion prefix with fuzzy matches on the bundle
  tail when candidates exist.
* Malformed manifests never raise -- the parser returns ``None`` or
  drops individual keys, so :func:`get_bundle` returns partial data
  with a ``warnings`` list populated (for :func:`read_bundle_manifest`
  which surfaces warnings; :func:`get_bundle` does not).
