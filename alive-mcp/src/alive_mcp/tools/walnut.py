"""Walnut-centric read tools (fn-10-60k.6 / T6).

Three tools, all read-only, all annotated
``ToolAnnotations(readOnlyHint=True, destructiveHint=False,
openWorldHint=False)``:

* :func:`list_walnuts` -- inventory the current World as
  ``{walnuts: [{path, name, domain, goal, health, updated}, ...],
  next_cursor}`` with opaque base64-encoded cursor pagination.
* :func:`get_walnut_state` -- read the ``_kernel/now.json`` projection
  for a walnut identified by POSIX-relpath, with v3 -> v2 fallback. Does
  NOT trigger on-demand assembly (that's v0.2 territory).
* :func:`read_walnut_kernel` -- read a whole kernel file
  (``key | log | insights | now``) and return ``{content, mime}``. No
  pagination -- T9's ``read_log`` owns chunking the log.

Frozen contract notes (from the epic spec, reproduced here so the file is
self-contained for reviewers):

* ``walnut`` param is ALWAYS a POSIX relative path from the World root
  (e.g. ``02_Life/people/ben-flint``). Not a bare name -- names collide
  across domains (there is a ``ben-flint`` under ``People/``, under
  ``02_Life/people/``, and potentially a past archive entry). ``path``
  is the canonical identifier callers echo back.
* ``domain`` is the first path segment. ``02_Life/people/ben-flint`` ->
  ``02_Life``. Non-ALIVE-prefixed paths (worlds without domain
  numbering) return ``domain = None``.
* ``health`` follows the Hermes algorithm documented at
  ``hermes/memory-provider/__init__.py::_find_walnuts``:
  ``days_since <= rhythm_days`` -> ``active``;
  ``<= rhythm_days * 2`` -> ``quiet``; else ``waiting``;
  ``unknown`` when ``rhythm`` or ``updated`` is missing.
* All three tools are wrapped with :func:`audited` so T12 can layer the
  audit writer on without touching tool code.
* Every error path returns an ``envelope.error`` envelope. Tools never
  raise out to FastMCP -- the caretaker contract forbids plain
  exceptions on the tool surface.

Walnut discovery heuristic
--------------------------
A directory is a walnut iff it contains ``_kernel/key.md``. We use
``Path.rglob("_kernel/key.md")`` under the resolved World root. This
matches Hermes' validated behavior at 43 walnuts in <1s on Patrick's
machine (the acceptance target). Rglob descends into hidden/dotfile
directories by default; we don't filter those out at the top level
because a World's ``.alive/`` doesn't contain walnuts and rglob natively
skips it when there's no ``_kernel/key.md`` inside (there isn't, so the
cost is cheap directory traversal, not a correctness hazard).

The domain sentinel list is consulted only for the ``domain`` field on
each walnut record, NOT as a filter -- Worlds that don't follow the
numbering convention still list their walnuts, just with
``domain = None``.

Cursor pagination
-----------------
Cursors are opaque tokens: base64url(``str(offset)``). Stateless (the
full walnut list is recomputed each call -- acceptable at 43-walnut
scale; T8 re-evaluates for search tools). Invalid cursors return
``ERR_INVALID_CURSOR``. Cursors do not survive server restart because
inventory ordering is a function of the filesystem at call time;
callers get a diagnostic via the suggestions field when they retry with
a stale cursor.
