"""Encoder + decoder for the ``alive://`` URI scheme (fn-10-60k.10 / T10).

The scheme is the wire identity of every kernel-file resource exposed by
alive-mcp. It is ALSO the URI that T11's ``resources/updated`` notifications
will carry, and the URI v0.2 bundle resources will extend. Locking it here
-- encoder, decoder, and contract tests -- keeps the format stable as more
resource families land.

Scheme contract (frozen)

.. code-block:: text

    alive://walnut/{walnut_path}/kernel/{file}

``{walnut_path}``
    POSIX relative path from the World root (e.g.
    ``02_Life/people/ben-flint``, ``04_Ventures/supernormal-systems/clients/
    elite-oceania``). Percent-encoded per RFC 3986 path-segment rules,
    with a deliberate exception: **forward slashes ``/`` are preserved as
    literal path separators**; every OTHER reserved path-segment character
    IS percent-encoded. Spaces -> ``%20``. Unicode text is normalized to
    NFC before encoding so equivalent forms round-trip to the same URI.

``{file}``
    Literal drawn from ``{"key", "log", "insights", "now"}``. No encoding
    applied -- all four are URL-safe ASCII. An unknown value is rejected
    by :func:`decode_kernel_uri` with ``InvalidURIError``.

==================================================================== ============================================================================

Why a custom scheme
-------------------
``file://`` would be wrong on two fronts:

1. Semantics: some MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor) map ``file://``
   to raw-filesystem resource semantics -- they try to interpret the
   URI as an absolute filesystem path. ``alive://`` signals
   "ALIVE-specific handling required".
2. Safety: a ``file://`` URL pointing outside the World would be a
   valid URL by the URL spec. Our containment check still catches that,
   but the separation means a client can't confuse ``file://`` handlers
   with our resource handlers by accident.

The scheme name is ``alive``. URIs are lowercase in the scheme component
(``alive://...``); RFC 3986 requires scheme-case-insensitivity, but we
emit the canonical lowercase form everywhere.

Why the encoder preserves ``/`` inside ``walnut_path``
------------------------------------------------------
``urllib.parse.quote(safe="/")`` does this natively -- ``safe`` is the
whitelist of characters NOT to encode. We pass ``/`` so path separators
survive the round-trip as literal slashes, which means:

- ``resources/list`` output reads naturally (``alive://walnut/02_Life/
  people/ben-flint/kernel/log``) rather than opaque
  (``alive://walnut/02_Life%2Fpeople%2Fben-flint/kernel/log``).
- FastMCP's template matcher ``(?P<param>[^/]+)`` cannot capture a
  ``/`` anyway (tested in T10 against mcp>=1.27). Our resource handler
  therefore parses the whole URI ourselves, not the template matcher.

Why NFC normalization
---------------------
macOS filesystem (HFS+, APFS) uses NFD for filename storage. A path
containing an accented character (``\u00e9``) may arrive either as NFC
(``\u00e9``) or NFD (``e\u0301``); both percent-encode to DIFFERENT
bytes. Normalizing to NFC first means the same logical path always
produces the same URI, so ``resources/list`` entries match
``resources/read`` requests the client sends back.

NFC is the IETF default for URL internationalization (RFC 3987) and the
Unicode TR#36 recommendation for "canonical form before I/O". NFD would
work too but NFC is shorter on-the-wire for the common case.

Decoder contract
----------------
:func:`decode_kernel_uri` validates:

1. Scheme is exactly ``alive``.
2. Authority (host) is exactly ``walnut``.
3. Path starts with ``/`` followed by at least one percent-encoded
   segment, then ``/kernel/<file>``.
4. ``<file>`` is one of ``key | log | insights | now``.
5. After percent-decoding, the walnut path has no empty segments, no
   ``.`` or ``..`` segments, and does not start with ``/`` (which would
   indicate an absolute path leaking through).

Any other shape raises :class:`InvalidURIError`, which callers map to the
MCP error code ``-32602`` (InvalidParams) so malformed URIs do not take
down a server session. The decoded ``walnut_path`` is the SAME POSIX
relpath the encoder accepted -- callers can feed it into
:func:`alive_mcp.paths.safe_join` unchanged.

Public API
----------
- :func:`encode_kernel_uri(walnut_path, file) -> str`
- :func:`decode_kernel_uri(uri) -> (walnut_path, file)`

- :class:`InvalidURIError` -- raised on any malformed URI.
