# Bundles

A bundle is a self-contained unit of work inside a walnut. Lives flat in the walnut root alongside `_kernel/`. Any folder with a `context.manifest.yaml` is a bundle.

---

## Two Species

Same anatomy, different destiny.

**Outcome bundles** — produce something specific. Goal describes a deliverable ("Rebuild stellarforge.space from TWD strategy deck"). Iterates through versioned drafts. Has a done state.

**Evergreen bundles** — accumulate related context over time. Goal describes a collection or ongoing concern ("Collect and index all Nova Station call transcripts"). The manifest IS the value — synthesizes what's in raw/. Status stays `active` (ongoing) or `done` (retired).

Evergreen bundles CAN have non-versioned documents inside (synthesis.md, patterns.md) — these are derived context, not v0.x progression. If a synthesis grows big enough to need its own drafts, it spawns an outcome bundle.

No `bundle_type:` field needed — the `goal:` field tells you which kind it is. A deliverable goal = outcome. A collection/ongoing goal = evergreen.

### Files

| File | Purpose | Required |
|------|---------|----------|
| `context.manifest.yaml` | Bundle index — identity, status, sources, sessions | Yes |
| `tasks.json` | Work queue scoped to this bundle (script-operated via tasks.py) | No (created when first task added) |
| `raw/` | Source material — documents, screenshots, data | No |

---

## The Context Manifest

The `context.manifest.yaml` file is the bundle's identity and scannable index. Everything a squirrel needs to understand the bundle at a glance.

### Full Schema

```yaml
# === Identity ===
goal: "One sentence describing what this bundle produces or collects"
status: draft                          # draft | prototype | published | done

sensitivity: private                   # open | private | restricted
pii: false                            # whether raw/ contains personally identifiable info
species: outcome                       # outcome | evergreen (optional — inferred from goal)

# === Relationships ===
linked_bundles: [[website], [brand-brief]]
parent_bundle: null                    # if this is a sub-bundle
tags: [engineering, vendors]

# === Agent Sessions ===

```

### Required Fields

Only `goal:` and `status:` are required. Everything else has sensible defaults or is created when needed. The schema is lenient — unknown fields are ignored, every field defaults, no value validation.

---

## tasks.json

Bundle-scoped work queue. Tasks are script-operated via `tasks.py` CLI. The agent calls `tasks.py add/done/edit/list` — never reads or writes tasks.json directly.

JSON format. Schema per task:

```json
{
  "id": "t-001",
  "title": "Restructure intro section",
  "status": "active",
  "priority": "high",
  "bundle": "shielding-review",
  "assignee": "a8c95e9",
  "due": "2026-03-20",
  "tags": ["writing", "structure"],
  "created": "2026-03-12",
  "session": "a8c95e9"
}
```

Completed tasks move to `_kernel/completed.json` via `tasks.py done`. The bundle's tasks.json only holds open work.

Tasks here are scoped to this bundle only. Walnut-level tasks that span bundles live in the walnut's own task tracking.

---

## Agent Observations

Agent observations route through the stash at save time. Significant observations become log entries. No separate observations file.

---

## Bundle Lifecycle

Bundles have a status-based lifecycle. Versions are files inside the bundle.

```
draft       -> prototype   -> published   -> done
started       has visual     shared        outputs complete
```

- **draft** — actively being worked on. Markdown only.
- **prototype** — has a visual (HTML), maybe shared with 1-2 people.
- **published** — shared externally. Manifest tracks `published:` metadata.
- **done** — outputs complete. Bundle stays where it is as the historical record.

Version files inside the bundle use the bundle name for self-documentation:
- `{bundle-name}-draft-{nn}.md` — working drafts (e.g., `shielding-review-draft-01.md`)
- `{bundle-name}-draft-{nn}.html` — visual versions (optional)
- `{bundle-name}-v1.md` / `{bundle-name}-v1.html` — the final version

### Before Iterating

Every version after v0.1 should update the `context:` field in the manifest about what changed. The manifest forces the question: what worked, what didn't, what's different this time?

---

## Graduation

### Outcome bundle -> done

- Mechanical signal: a `*-v1.md` (or `*-v1.html`) file gets written
- Squirrel notices and asks: "v1 exists. Graduate this bundle?"
- Human confirms -> status flips to `done` or `published` in manifest
- Bundle folder STAYS WHERE IT IS — no folder moves
- The graduated output lives inside the bundle folder alongside the manifest
- Two keys to turn: v1 exists + human says yes.

### Bundle -> walnut graduation

When a bundle outgrows its parent walnut:

- Pure judgment. Squirrel surfaces when bundle gets heavy.
- Signals: too many sources, needs own sessions/log/people, own rhythm, independent lifecycle
- context.manifest.yaml seeds the new walnut's `_kernel/key.md`
- Three levels of growth: raw material -> bundle -> graduated bundle -> walnut

```
╭─ this bundle is getting heavy
│  12 sources, 3 active sessions, own task list growing.
│
│  ▸ Graduate to its own walnut?
│  1. Yeah, promote it
│  2. Keep it as a bundle
│  3. Let me think about it
╰─
```

---

## Bundle Routing Heuristic

When content arrives or work begins:

```
Does an active bundle match this goal?
|-- Yes, exact match -> add to it
|-- Related but different goal -> new bundle, link to existing
|-- Ambiguous -> ask once
+-- No match -> new bundle
```

The core heuristic is **goal alignment**:
- Same goal -> same bundle
- Related goal -> linked bundles (not merge)
- Different goal -> new bundle
- Goal outgrew the bundle -> bundle -> walnut graduation

When ambiguous, ask once:

```
╭─ this relates to [[existing-bundle]]
│  Add to it, or start a fresh bundle?
│
│  ▸ Which one?
│  1. Add to existing
│  2. Start fresh
│  3. Link them
╰─
```

### Merge is Rare

If two bundles overlap, link them or spawn a third that synthesizes both. Only merge when "these should never have been separate" — pick primary, move other's raw/ in, archive empty shell. Never merge silently.

---

## Sub-Bundles

Bundles can nest directly inside other bundle folders. Unlimited depth, no intermediate directory needed.

```
product-launch/
  context.manifest.yaml
  tasks.json
  landing-page/                          <- sub-bundle
    context.manifest.yaml
    tasks.json
    raw/
  email-sequence/                        <- sub-bundle
    context.manifest.yaml
    tasks.json
    raw/
```

Sub-bundles record their parent: `parent_bundle: product-launch` in manifest. The parent manifest doesn't need to enumerate children — the filesystem does that.

Use sub-bundles when a bundle has clearly separable workstreams that benefit from independent tracking. Don't nest deeper than two levels — if a sub-bundle needs its own sub-bundles, it should probably be its own walnut.

---

## Context Routing (Bidirectional Flow)

Bundles and their parent walnut exchange context in both directions.

### Bundle -> Walnut Kernel

At save, the squirrel routes confirmed items from the bundle back to the walnut:
- Decisions -> `_kernel/log.md` (prepended as log entries)
- Confirmed insights -> `_kernel/insights.md`
- People updates -> `_kernel/key.md` people section (or `_kernel/people.yaml`)
- Tasks route via `tasks.py` — not direct file writes
- now.json is computed by `project.py` post-save — agent doesn't write to it
- Manifest's `context:` field is updated by the agent at save (this feeds into project.py's projection)

### Walnut Kernel -> Bundle

When opening a bundle, the squirrel reads the walnut kernel first (key.md, now.json, insights.md) to establish context. The walnut's identity and standing knowledge inform bundle work.

---

## Sensitivity

Three levels of sensitivity per bundle:

| Level | Meaning | Sharing |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `open` | No restrictions | Can be published to walnut.world |
| `private` | Internal only | Not shared externally, not published |
| `restricted` | Sensitive content | Flagged for extra caution, PII check |

When `pii: true`, the squirrel warns before any sharing or publishing operation. Raw files in restricted bundles are never included in exports or snapshots.

---

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

### 1. Active session claim

`active_sessions:` in manifest (spec above). Claimed by load-context, cleaned by save. Others see who's working and what they're touching.

### 2. Bundle-scoped tasks

Each bundle has its own `tasks.json`, operated through `tasks.py`. This is the single source of truth for work items in that bundle. No split between bundle and walnut task lists.

### 3. Immutable version files

Create v0.4.md, don't edit v0.3.md. If concurrent agents work on different aspects, they write different version files. Merge in next version.

### 4. Distributed tasks

When multiple agents work on a bundle, each claims specific tasks via `tasks.py` with session attribution. Unclaimed tasks are available. Two agents should never work the same task simultaneously.

---

## Cross-Bundle References

References live inside bundles. The context manifest IS the index.

### Three Tiers

1. **Scan** — Manifest `sources:` list. The squirrel scans `*/context.manifest.yaml` and reads the sources array. Each source has `path:`, `description:`, `type:`, `date:`. This IS the index.
2. **Read** — Manifest `context:` field. Current state of the bundle.
3. **Deep** — Raw files in `{bundle}/raw/`. Only loaded on explicit request.

The squirrel scans tier 1 (manifest sources) at open or on demand. Goes to tier 2 (context) when specific context is needed. Goes to tier 3 (raw) only when specifically asked.

### Shared Sources

When a source feeds multiple bundles:
- The raw file lives where it was first captured
- Other bundles link to it via `sources:` path in their manifest
- One source of truth, multiple consumers
- Path references are relative: `../other-bundle/raw/filename.md`

---

## Mining State

For research-heavy or evergreen bundles, the `mining:` field tracks source exhaustion:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `active` | Actively gathering sources, more expected |
| `paused` | Temporarily stopped gathering, will resume |
| `exhausted` | All known sources captured, analysis phase |

This is optional. Most outcome bundles don't need it — it's for bundles where source collection is a significant part of the work.

---

## Stale Bundles

Bundles in `draft` status unchanged for 30+ days are surfaced by system cleanup:

```
╭─ stale bundle detected
│  "shielding-review" has been in draft for 45 days
│
│  ▸ What should we do?
│  1. Advance it (move to prototype)
│  2. Archive it (set status to done, note reason)
│  3. Kill it (draft bundles are disposable)
│  4. Leave it for now
╰─
```

- **Advance** -> move to prototype or published
- **Archive** -> set status to done, note reason in context
- **Kill** -> delete (bundles in draft are disposable)

---

## Sharing and walnut.world

Bundles with `sensitivity: open` can be published to walnut.world. The `published:` field in the manifest tracks what's been shared:

```yaml
published:
  - slug: orbital-safety-brief
    url: https://you.walnut.world/orbital-safety-brief
    date: 2026-03-20
```

Publishing is always explicit — the squirrel asks, the human confirms. The bundle's final output (v1+) is what gets published, not the raw sources or draft history.

---

## Legacy Support

### Capsules -> Bundles -> Flat Migration

Walnuts with older formats are fully supported. The mapping:

| v1 (Capsules) | v2 (Bundles) | v3 (Flat) |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| `_core/_capsules/` | `bundles/` | walnut root (flat) |
| `companion.md` | `context.manifest.yaml` | `context.manifest.yaml` |
| `## Tasks` (pointer to walnut tasks) | `tasks.md` (bundle-scoped) | `tasks.json` (script-operated) |
| `## Work Log` (in companion body) | `observations.md` (standalone) | stash -> log at save |
| `## Changelog` (in companion body) | `context:` field in manifest | `context:` field in manifest |
| `sources:` (in companion frontmatter) | `sources:` (in manifest) | `sources:` (in manifest) |
| `linked_capsules:` | `linked_bundles:` | `linked_bundles:` |
| Reference capsule | Evergreen bundle | Evergreen bundle |
| Work capsule | Outcome bundle | Outcome bundle |

Migration is not forced. The squirrel reads all formats. When an older format is actively worked on, the squirrel can offer to migrate it:

```
╭─ this bundle uses an older format
│
│  ▸ Migrate to v3 structure?
│  1. Yeah, migrate now
│  2. Keep the old format
╰─
```

### _working/ and _references/

Walnuts with `_core/_working/` and `_core/_references/` still work. The three-tier concept is the same — just the storage location differs. Legacy companions are scanned the same way. Migration converts them to flat bundles.
