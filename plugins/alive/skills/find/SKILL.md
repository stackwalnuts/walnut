# Find

Search across the world. One verb for all retrieval.

## How It Searches

Priority order — fastest and highest signal first:

### 1. Frontmatter Scan (fast, structured)
Scan `_core/key.md` across all walnuts. Matches on: type, goal, people names, tags, links, reference descriptions.

### 2. Insights Search (standing knowledge)
Scan `_core/insights.md` across relevant walnuts. Domain knowledge that persists — "Nova Station test windows are Tue-Thu only."

### 3. Log Search (decisions, history)
Search `_core/log.md` entries. Signed decisions, session summaries, what happened when. Frontmatter first (last-entry, summary), then entry bodies.

### 4. Task Search (work queue)
Scan `_core/tasks.md` across walnuts. Find tasks by status, age, attribution.

### 5. Working File Search (drafts)
Scan `_core/_working/` across walnuts. Find drafts by name, version, age, squirrel attribution.

### 6. Reference Companion Search (captured content metadata)
Search `_core/_references/` companion .md files. Match on frontmatter: type, date, source, participants, subject.

### 7. Raw Reference Search (last resort, expensive)
Load actual raw files. Only on explicit request — "read me that email from Jax."
