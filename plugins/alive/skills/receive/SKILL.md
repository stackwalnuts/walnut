description: "Import a .walnut package into the world. Detects encryption, validates integrity (checksums + path safety), previews contents, and routes into a new walnut (full scope), existing walnut capsules (capsule scope), or read-only view (snapshot scope)."
user-invocable: true
---

# Receive

Import walnut context from someone else. The import side of P2P sharing.

A `.walnut` file is always a single gzip-compressed tar archive. Three scopes: full walnut handoff (creates new walnut), capsule-level import (into existing walnut), or a snapshot for read-only viewing. Handles encryption detection and integrity validation before writing anything.

**Encrypted packages** contain `manifest.yaml` (cleartext, for preview) alongside `payload.enc` (the encrypted content). Decryption uses `openssl` -- fully session-driven, no terminal interaction. **Unencrypted packages** contain `manifest.yaml` alongside the content files directly.

---

## Prerequisites

Read the format spec before processing any package. The template lives relative to the plugin install path:

```
templates/walnut-package/format-spec.md    -- full format specification
templates/walnut-package/manifest.yaml     -- manifest template with field docs
```

The squirrel MUST read both files before importing. Do not reconstruct the manifest schema from memory. Do NOT spawn an Explore agent or search for these files -- the paths above are authoritative.

**World root discovery:** The world root is the ALIVE folder containing `01_Archive/`, `02_Life/`, `03_Inputs/`, `04_Ventures/`, `05_Experiments/`. Discover it by walking up from the current walnut's path or by reading the `.alive/` directory location. All target paths for import MUST resolve inside this root.

**Installed plugin version:** Read the plugin version from `walnut.manifest.yaml` at the plugin root. If the version cannot be determined, warn the human and skip the plugin version compatibility check in Step 4b -- do not assume a default version.

---

## Entry Points

Two ways this skill gets invoked:

### 1. Direct invocation

The human runs `/alive:receive` with a file path argument (or the squirrel asks for it):

```
/alive:receive ~/Desktop/nova-station-capsule-2026-03-26.walnut
```

If no path argument, ask:

```
╭─ 🐿️ receive
│
│  Where's the .walnut file?
│  ▸ Path?
╰─
```

### 2. Inbox scan delegation

The capture skill's inbox scan detects a `.walnut` file in `03_Inputs/` and delegates here. When delegated, the file path is already known -- skip the path prompt and proceed to Step 1.

---

## Flow

### Step 1 -- Extract Outer Archive and Read Manifest

Every `.walnut` file is a tar.gz. Extract it to a staging directory first:

```bash
STAGING=$(mktemp -d "/tmp/walnut-import-XXXXXXXX")
```

Extract the outer archive safely using the Python tarfile validation (same security validation used throughout -- see the full validation script in the reference section at the end of this file):

```bash
python3 -c '<SAFE_EXTRACT_SCRIPT>' "$STAGING" "<package-path>"
```

**Agent state note:** Shell variables do not persist between separate Bash tool calls. The squirrel MUST store the staging directory path in its own conversation state (note it after creation) and explicitly clean up staging in every abort path and at the end of Step 8.

After extraction, read `$STAGING/manifest.yaml`. This is always cleartext, even in encrypted packages. Show a preview:

```
╭─ 🐿️ package preview
│
│  Source:   nova-station
│  Scope:    capsule (shielding-review, safety-brief)
│  Created:  2026-03-26
│  Files:    8
│  Encrypted: no
│
│  Note: "Two capsules from the shielding review -- one still in draft."
│
│  ▸ Import?
│  1. Yes
│  2. Cancel
╰─
```

---

### Step 2 -- Encryption Detection and Decryption

Check if the extracted staging directory contains `payload.enc`. If yes, the content is encrypted.

```bash
test -f "$STAGING/payload.enc" && echo "ENCRYPTED" || echo "CLEARTEXT"
```

**If CLEARTEXT:** The content files are already extracted alongside the manifest. Proceed to Step 3.

**If ENCRYPTED:**

Collect the passphrase through the session:

```
╭─ 🐿️ encrypted package
│
│  This package is encrypted.
│
│  ▸ Enter the passphrase:
╰─
```

Decrypt `payload.enc` to a temporary inner archive, then extract it into the staging directory:

```bash
# Decrypt the payload
INNER_TAR=$(mktemp "/tmp/walnut-inner-XXXXXXXX.tar.gz")
WALNUT_PASSPHRASE="<passphrase-from-session>" \
  openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 600000 \
  -in "$STAGING/payload.enc" \
  -out "$INNER_TAR" \
  -pass env:WALNUT_PASSPHRASE

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "DECRYPTION_FAILED"
  rm -f "$INNER_TAR"
else
  echo "DECRYPTED"
fi
```

If decryption fails, surface it and offer to retry:

```
╭─ 🐿️ decryption failed
│
│  Wrong passphrase or corrupted package.
│
│  ▸ Try again?
│  1. Yes
│  2. Cancel
╰─
```

On success, extract the inner archive into staging (same Python validation), then clean up:

```bash
# Extract inner archive content into staging using safe extraction
python3 -c '<SAFE_EXTRACT_SCRIPT>' "$STAGING" "$INNER_TAR"

# Clean up: remove payload.enc and inner tar
rm -f "$INNER_TAR" "$STAGING/payload.enc"
```

After this step, the staging directory looks the same whether the package was encrypted or not: `manifest.yaml` + content files. All subsequent steps are identical.

**Passphrase handling:** The passphrase MUST be passed via `env:` (environment variable), never as a CLI argument (visible in `ps`) or written to a file. The `WALNUT_PASSPHRASE=... openssl ...` syntax sets it for that single command only.

---

### Step 3 -- Post-Extraction Safety Validation (defense in depth)

**This is a security requirement. Do NOT skip.**

Step 2 already validates archive members via Python's `tarfile` and only extracts regular files and directories. This step is defense-in-depth -- it walks the extracted filesystem to catch anything unexpected:

```bash
python3 -c '
import os, sys, stat

staging = sys.argv[1]
staging_real = os.path.realpath(staging)
violations = []

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(staging, followlinks=False):
    for name in dirs + files:
        full = os.path.join(root, name)
        rel = os.path.relpath(full, staging)
        if ".." in rel.split(os.sep):
            violations.append(f"Path traversal: {rel}")
        if os.path.islink(full):
            target = os.readlink(full)
            violations.append(f"Symlink rejected: {rel} -> {target}")
            continue
        st = os.lstat(full)
        if not (stat.S_ISREG(st.st_mode) or stat.S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)):
            violations.append(f"Special file rejected: {rel} (mode {oct(st.st_mode)})")
        real = os.path.realpath(full)
        if real != staging_real and not real.startswith(staging_real + os.sep):
            violations.append(f"Path escape: {rel} resolves to {real}")

if violations:
    for v in violations:
        print(v, file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
print("All paths safe.")
' "$STAGING"
```

If any violations are found, abort the import and clean up staging:

```
╭─ 🐿️ import blocked
│
│  This package contains unsafe paths:
│  - [violation details]
│
│  Import aborted. The package may be corrupted or malicious.
╰─
```

```bash
rm -rf "$STAGING"
```

---

### Step 4 -- Manifest Validation

Read `manifest.yaml` from the staging root. **Do NOT `cat` directly** -- manifest content is untrusted. Read via Python and strip control characters before displaying:

```bash
python3 -c '
import sys
with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
    text = f.read()
# Strip ASCII control chars (C0 except \n and \t, DEL, C1 range)
# \r is NOT allowed (can rewrite prior terminal content)
cleaned = "".join(c if (c in "\n\t" or 0x20 <= ord(c) < 0x7f or ord(c) > 0x9f) else "?" for c in text)
print(cleaned)
' "$STAGING/manifest.yaml"
```

#### 4a. Format version check

Parse `format_version` from the manifest. Check the major version:

- **Major version matches** (currently `1.x.x`) -- proceed.
- **Major version mismatch** -- block:

```
╭─ 🐿️ import blocked
│
│  This package uses format version X.Y.Z.
│  This plugin supports version 1.x.x.
│
│  A newer version of the ALIVE plugin may be required.
╰─
```

- **Minor version ahead** (e.g. package is `1.3.0`, plugin supports `1.0.0`) -- warn but proceed:

```
╭─ 🐿️ heads up
│
│  This package uses format version 1.3.0 (newer than this plugin's 1.0.0).
│  Some optional features may not be recognized. Proceeding anyway.
╰─
```

#### 4b. Plugin version check

Parse `source.plugin_version` from the manifest. Compare the major version against the installed plugin's major version.

- **Major mismatch** -- block with a clear message about updating the plugin.
- **Match** -- proceed.

#### 4c. SHA-256 checksum and size validation

**Note on scope:** Checksums detect transit corruption and accidental modification. They do NOT provide authenticity -- a malicious sender can craft valid checksums. This is a known limitation of v1. Future versions may add signatures.

Validate every file listed in `manifest.files` against its `sha256` checksum and `size`:

```bash
python3 -c '
import hashlib, sys, os, re, stat

MAX_FILE_SIZE = 500 * 1024 * 1024  # 500 MB per file
MAX_TOTAL_SIZE = 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024  # 2 GB total

staging = os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1])
manifest_path = os.path.join(staging, "manifest.yaml")

with open(manifest_path) as f:
    manifest_text = f.read()

# Regex matches the manifest template exact structure (avoids PyYAML dependency).
# CONSTRAINT: manifest must use LF line endings, lowercase hex sha256, exact key
# ordering (path/sha256/size), and standard YAML quoting. The share skill enforces
# this format. If a manifest uses different formatting, this fails closed (no entries = abort).
ENTRY_RE = re.compile(
    r"- path: \"?([^\"\n]+)\"?\n\s+sha256: \"?([a-f0-9]{64})\"?\n\s+size: (\d+)"
)
entries = []
for m in ENTRY_RE.finditer(manifest_text):
    raw_path = m.group(1).strip()
    norm_path = os.path.normpath(raw_path)
    while norm_path.startswith("./"):
        norm_path = norm_path[2:]
    entries.append({"path": norm_path, "sha256": m.group(2), "size": int(m.group(3))})

errors = []
verified = 0

if not entries:
    print("No file entries found in manifest -- may be malformed or empty.", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

declared_total = sum(e["size"] for e in entries)
if declared_total > MAX_TOTAL_SIZE:
    print(f"Package declares {declared_total} bytes total -- exceeds {MAX_TOTAL_SIZE} byte cap.", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

for entry in entries:
    path = entry["path"]
    if os.path.isabs(path) or ".." in path.split("/"):
        errors.append(f"Unsafe manifest path: {path}")
        continue
    fpath = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(staging, path))
    if not fpath.startswith(staging + os.sep):
        errors.append(f"Path escape via manifest: {path}")
        continue
    if not os.path.exists(fpath):
        errors.append(f"Missing: {path}")
        continue
    st = os.lstat(fpath)
    if not stat.S_ISREG(st.st_mode):
        errors.append(f"Not a regular file: {path} (mode {oct(st.st_mode)})")
        continue
    actual_size = st.st_size
    if actual_size != entry["size"]:
        errors.append(f"Size mismatch: {path} (expected {entry['size']}, got {actual_size})")
        continue
    if actual_size > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
        errors.append(f"File too large: {path} ({actual_size} bytes)")
        continue
    h = hashlib.sha256()
    with open(fpath, "rb") as f:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(65536)
            if not chunk:
                break
            h.update(chunk)
    if h.hexdigest() != entry["sha256"]:
        errors.append(f"Checksum mismatch: {path}")
    else:
        verified += 1

listed_paths = {e["path"] for e in entries}
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(staging):
    for name in files:
        full = os.path.join(root, name)
        rel = os.path.normpath(os.path.relpath(full, staging))
        while rel.startswith("./"):
            rel = rel[2:]
        if rel == "manifest.yaml":
            continue
        if rel not in listed_paths:
            errors.append(f"Unlisted file: {rel}")

if errors:
    for e in errors:
        print(e, file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
print(f"{verified} files verified.")
' "$STAGING"
```

If any checksums fail, sizes mismatch, or files are missing/unlisted, show the errors and abort:

```
╭─ 🐿️ integrity check failed
│
│  [error details]
│
│  Import aborted. The package may have been corrupted in transit.
╰─
```

Clean up staging on any failure.

---

### Step 5 -- Content Preview

**Display safety:** All manifest fields (`source.walnut`, `description`, `note`, capsule names) and `.walnut.meta` content are untrusted input from the sender. Before displaying any string from these sources in bordered blocks, strip control characters: reject anything below U+0020 except `\n` and `\t` (NOT `\r` -- carriage return can rewrite prior terminal content), plus DEL (U+007F) and C1 range (U+0080-U+009F). Replace stripped chars with `?` or omit. Apply the same sanitization in Step 1 (meta preview).

Read the manifest and show what's inside:

```
╭─ 🐿️ package contents
│
│  Source:     nova-station
│  Scope:     capsule
│  Capsules:  shielding-review, safety-brief
│  Files:     12
│  Created:   2026-03-26T12:00:00Z
│  Encrypted: yes (decrypted successfully)
│
│  Description: Evaluate radiation shielding vendors for habitat module
│
│  Note: "Two capsules from the shielding review -- one still in draft."
│
│  ▸ Proceed with import?
│  1. Yes
│  2. Cancel
╰─
```

If any capsules have `sensitivity: restricted` or `pii: true`, surface prominently:

```
╭─ 🐿️ sensitivity notice
│
│  vendor-analysis has pii: true
│  safety-brief has sensitivity: restricted
│
│  These flags were set by the sender. Review content carefully.
╰─
```

---

### Step 6 -- Target Selection

Routing depends on scope. **All target paths MUST resolve inside the world root.** Before writing anything, verify:

```bash
python3 -c '
import os, sys
target = os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1])
world = os.path.realpath(sys.argv[2])
try:
    common = os.path.commonpath([target, world])
except ValueError:
    common = ""
if common != world or target == world:
    print(f"Target {target} is not inside world root {world}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
print("Target path validated.")
' "<target-path>" "<world-root>"
```

#### Full scope

Always creates a new walnut. Ask which ALIVE domain:

```
╭─ 🐿️ import target
│
│  Full walnut import creates a new walnut.
│
│  ▸ Which domain?
│  1. 02_Life/
│  2. 04_Ventures/
│  3. 05_Experiments/
╰─
```

The walnut name defaults to the source walnut name from the manifest. If a walnut with that name already exists in the chosen domain, ask:

```
╭─ 🐿️ name collision
│
│  A walnut named "nova-station" already exists at 04_Ventures/nova-station/.
│
│  ▸ What to do?
│  1. Rename -- pick a new name
│  2. Cancel
╰─
```

No merge for MVP. Full import always creates fresh.

#### Capsule scope

Import into an existing walnut. Ask which one:

```
╭─ 🐿️ import target
│
│  Capsule import goes into an existing walnut.
│
│  ▸ Which walnut?
│  [list active walnuts from the world, or type a path]
╰─
```

To list active walnuts, scan the ALIVE domains (`02_Life/`, `04_Ventures/`, `05_Experiments/`) for directories containing `_core/key.md`. Present as a numbered list.

If the package contains multiple capsules, default all to the chosen walnut. Offer per-capsule override:

```
╭─ 🐿️ capsule routing
│
│  Importing 2 capsules into [target-walnut]:
│  1. shielding-review
│  2. safety-brief
│
│  ▸ All to [target-walnut], or route individually?
│  1. All to [target-walnut]
│  2. Route each separately
╰─
```

#### Snapshot scope

Read-only view. Show the content without creating or modifying anything:

```
╭─ 🐿️ snapshot from nova-station
│
│  This is a read-only status briefing. Nothing will be written.
│
│  [Show key.md goal, now.md context paragraph, insights frontmatter]
│
│  ▸ Done viewing, or capture as a reference?
│  1. Done
│  2. Capture into a walnut as a reference
╰─
```

If the human picks "Capture as a reference", ask which walnut, then write the snapshot content as a companion in `_core/_references/snapshots/` with type `snapshot`.

---

### Step 7 -- Content Routing

This is the core write step. Behavior depends on scope.

#### 7a. Full scope -- Create new walnut

Follow the walnut scaffolding pattern from `skills/create/SKILL.md`:

1. Create the directory structure at `<domain>/<walnut-name>/`
2. Copy `_core/` contents from staging to the new walnut's `_core/` using safe rsync:
   ```bash
   rsync -rt --no-links --no-specials --no-devices -- "$STAGING/_core/" "<target-walnut>/_core/"
   ```
   This strips foreign permissions/ownership and rejects any special files that survived extraction.
3. Create `_core/_capsules/` if not present in the package

**Handle log.md via bash** (the log guardian hook blocks Write tool on log.md; Edit is allowed for prepending new entries but NOT for modifying signed entries):

If the package includes `_core/log.md`, write the entire file via bash first (this is a new walnut, so no existing signed entries to protect):

```bash
cat -- "$STAGING/_core/log.md" > "<target-walnut>/_core/log.md"
```

Then prepend an import entry at the top of the log (after frontmatter) using the Edit tool (this is a new unsigned entry, which the log guardian allows):

The import entry:

```markdown
## <ISO-timestamp> -- squirrel:<session_id>

Walnut imported from .walnut package. Source: <source-walnut> (packaged <created-date>).

### References Captured
- walnut-package: <original-filename> -- imported into <domain>/<walnut-name>/

signed: squirrel:<session_id>
```

Update the log.md frontmatter (`last-entry`, `entry-count`, `summary`) via Edit.

**Replace @session_id in tasks.md:**

If the package includes `_core/tasks.md`, replace foreign `@session_id` references with `@[source-walnut-name]`:

```bash
python3 -c '
import re, sys, pathlib
tasks_path = sys.argv[1]
source = sys.argv[2]
# Sanitize source name to prevent regex replacement backrefs
safe_source = re.sub(r"[^a-z0-9_-]", "-", source.lower())
text = pathlib.Path(tasks_path).read_text(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")
updated = re.sub(r"@([0-9a-f]{6,})", lambda m: f"@[{safe_source}]", text)
pathlib.Path(tasks_path).write_text(updated, encoding="utf-8")
' "<target-walnut>/_core/tasks.md" "<source-walnut-name>"
```

**Update now.md** with import context via Edit:
- Set `squirrel:` to the current session_id
- Set `updated:` to now
- Keep the existing `phase:` and `next:`

#### 7b. Capsule scope -- Route into existing walnut

For each capsule being imported:

1. **Check for name collision** -- does `_core/_capsules/<capsule-name>/` already exist?

If collision:

```
╭─ 🐿️ name collision
│
│  A capsule named "shielding-review" already exists in [target-walnut].
│
│  ▸ What to do?
│  1. Rename -- pick a new name for the imported capsule
│  2. Replace -- overwrite existing capsule
│  3. Skip -- don't import this capsule
╰─
```

2. **Copy capsule directory** from staging to `<target-walnut>/_core/_capsules/<capsule-name>/`

If the human chose "Replace" for a name collision, remove the existing capsule first:

```bash
# Only for "Replace" -- remove old capsule before copying new one
rm -rf "<target-walnut>/_core/_capsules/<capsule-name>"
```

Then copy (same for new capsules and replacements):

```bash
mkdir -p -- "<target-walnut>/_core/_capsules/<capsule-name>"
rsync -rt --no-links --no-specials --no-devices -- "$STAGING/_core/_capsules/<capsule-name>/" "<target-walnut>/_core/_capsules/<capsule-name>/"
```

Using `-rt` (recursive + timestamps) instead of `-a` avoids preserving foreign permissions, ownership, and group from the package. `--no-links --no-specials --no-devices` is defense-in-depth -- Step 2 already filtered these out, but this prevents accidental copies if the staging dir is modified between extraction and routing.

3. **Add `received_from:` to the capsule companion** -- edit `companion.md` to add provenance:

```yaml
received_from:
  source_walnut: "<source-walnut-name>"
  method: "walnut-package"
  date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
  package: "<original-filename>"
```

Use the Edit tool on the companion's frontmatter to add this field.

4. **Replace @session_id in tasks within capsule** (if any task-like content exists in version files):

Foreign `@session_id` references are replaced with `@[source-walnut-name]` -- same pattern as full scope.

5. **Flag unknown people** -- scan the imported companion for `people:` or person references (`[[name]]`). If any referenced people don't have walnuts in `02_Life/people/`, stash them:

```
╭─ 🐿️ +1 stash (N)
│  Unknown person referenced in imported capsule: [[kai-tanaka]]
│  → drop?
╰─
```

#### 7c. Snapshot scope -- Capture as reference (optional)

Only if the human chose "Capture as a reference" in Step 6.

Create a companion in the target walnut's `_core/_references/snapshots/`:

```bash
mkdir -p -- "<target-walnut>/_core/_references/snapshots"
```

Write a companion file:

```markdown
---
type: snapshot
description: "<source-walnut> status snapshot -- <description from manifest>"
source_walnut: "<source-walnut-name>"
date: <created-date-from-manifest>
received: <today's-date>
squirrel: <session_id>
tags: [imported, snapshot]
---

## Summary

Status snapshot from [[<source-walnut-name>]].

## Key Identity

[Contents of key.md from staging]

## Current State

[Contents of now.md from staging]

## Domain Knowledge

[Contents of insights.md from staging]

## Source

Imported from .walnut package: <original-filename>
```

---

### Step 8 -- Cleanup

Move the original `.walnut` file from its current location to the archive. If the file came from `03_Inputs/`, move it to `01_Archive/03_Inputs/`:

Only auto-archive files that came from `03_Inputs/`. Files from other locations (e.g. Desktop) are left where the human put them.

```bash
# Use pwd -P (physical, no symlinks) for reliable containment check
PACKAGE_REAL="$(cd "$(dirname "<package-path>")" && pwd -P)/$(basename "<package-path>")"
INPUTS_DIR="$(cd "<world-root>/03_Inputs" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)"

# Only archive if the package is inside 03_Inputs/ (or a subdirectory)
case "$PACKAGE_REAL" in
  "$INPUTS_DIR"/*)
    SHOULD_ARCHIVE=true ;;
  *)
    SHOULD_ARCHIVE=false ;;
esac

if [ "$SHOULD_ARCHIVE" = "true" ]; then
  ARCHIVE_DIR="<world-root>/01_Archive/03_Inputs"
  mkdir -p -- "$ARCHIVE_DIR"
  TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

  BASENAME="$(basename "<package-path>")"
  if [ -e "$ARCHIVE_DIR/$BASENAME" ]; then
    case "$BASENAME" in
      *.walnut) STEM="${BASENAME%.walnut}"; EXT="walnut" ;;
      *) STEM="${BASENAME%.*}"; EXT="${BASENAME##*.}" ;;
    esac
    BASENAME="${STEM}-${TIMESTAMP}.${EXT}"
  fi
  mv -- "<package-path>" "$ARCHIVE_DIR/$BASENAME"
fi
```

Clean up the staging directory:

```bash
rm -rf "$STAGING"
```

---

### Step 9 -- Stash & Summary

Stash the import event for logging at next save:

```
╭─ 🐿️ +1 stash (N)
│  Imported [scope] package from [source-walnut]: [capsule names or "full walnut"] into [target]
│  → drop?
╰─
```

Show the final summary:

**Full scope:**

**Snapshot scope (captured as reference):**

```
╭─ 🐿️ imported
│
│  Snapshot captured as reference in [target-walnut].
│  File: _core/_references/snapshots/<date>-<source>-snapshot.md
│  Source: nova-station
╰─
```

### Step 10 -- Post-import

Offer to open the imported content:

```
╭─ 🐿️ next
│
│  ▸ Open [walnut-name] now?
│  1. Yes -- /alive:load [name]
│  2. No -- stay here
╰─
```

For capsule imports, offer to open the target walnut (not the capsule directly -- capsules are opened via the walnut).

## Edge Cases

**Encrypted package with wrong passphrase:** The openssl decryption will fail. Offer to retry with a different passphrase.

**Empty capsule (companion only, no raw/drafts):** Import it. The companion context has value on its own.

**Cross-capsule relative paths in sources:** Preserve as-is. They're historical metadata. The paths will reference capsules that may not exist in the target walnut -- that's fine.

**Duplicate import (same package imported twice):** For MVP, just import again. The name collision handler (Step 7b) catches capsule conflicts. Let the human decide rename/replace/skip.

**Package with no `manifest.yaml`:** This is not a valid `.walnut` package. Show an error:

```
╭─ 🐿️ invalid package
│
│  No manifest.yaml found. This doesn't appear to be a valid .walnut package.
│  A .walnut file must contain manifest.yaml at its root.
╰─
```

**Corrupted archive (tar extraction fails):** Catch the error and report:

```
╭─ 🐿️ extraction failed
│
│  Could not extract the archive. It may be corrupted or not a valid .walnut file.
│  Error: [tar error message]
╰─
```

**Multiple `.walnut` files in `03_Inputs/`:** The inbox scan in capture handles this by listing all items. Each `.walnut` file is processed individually via a separate receive invocation.

**Package contains files outside `_core/`:** The format spec says packages contain `_core/` contents. Files outside `_core/` in the archive are flagged as unexpected in checksum validation (Step 4c, "unlisted file" check) and excluded.

## Scope Summary (Quick Reference)

| Scope | Creates | Target | User picks | Writes to log |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|---------------|
| **full** | New walnut | ALIVE domain | Domain | Via bash (new walnut) |
| **capsule** | Capsule dirs | Existing walnut | Walnut + optional per-capsule | Via stash (at save) |
| **snapshot** | Nothing (or reference) | View-only (or existing walnut) | View or capture | Via stash (if captured) |
