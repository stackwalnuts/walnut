REASON="Cannot write '${FILE_NAME}' to the world root. Nothing lives at root except the 5 Walnut domain folders (01_Archive through 05_Experiments) and hidden files. Route this to the right place: if it belongs to a walnut, put it in that walnut's _core/_capsules/ or live context. If it's an input, put it in 03_Inputs/. If it's a new project, create a walnut with walnut:create. Ask the human where it should go."
